    "### **Understanding the problem**\n",
    "Due to recent increases in power tariffs and rising energy costs in Nigeria, households are seeking alternative ways to reduce their electricity expenses. Solar panel installations are being promoted as a cost-effective and sustainable solution. A non-governmental organization wants to evaluate whether solar panel adoption significantly reduces household energy costs by comparing the energy expenses of households with and without solar panels.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Define Hypotheses**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis (H₀): Solar panel adoption does not reduce household energy costs (mean energy costs in households with solar panels = households without solar panels).\n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Solar panel adoption reduces household energy costs (mean energy costs in households with solar panels < households without solar panels).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select a Significance Level (α)**:\n",
    "    - Use a standard significance level, e.g., α = 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect and Analyze Data**:\n",
    "    - Select two datasets:\n",
    "        - **Dataset 1**: Monthly energy costs for households without solar panels.\n",
    "        - **Dataset 2**: Monthly energy costs for households with solar panels.\n",
    "    - Perform an independent two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two datasets:\n",
    "        - Check for assumptions like normality and equal variances.\n",
    "        - Compute the test statistic (t) and the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Make a Decision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the p-value ≤ 0.05, reject H₀ and conclude that solar panel adoption significantly reduces household energy costs.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, fail to reject H₀.\n",
